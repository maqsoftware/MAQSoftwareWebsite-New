# Product Page Spec — Fabric Admin Agent

> Sibling spec to [../industries/retail.md](../industries/retail.md) and
> [products.md](products.md). This is the **first** dedicated
> product landing page (richer than the generic `ProductDetail` shell).
> Future product landing pages (e.g. MigrateFAST, EmbedFAST) should reuse
> the section taxonomy defined here.
>
> Authoring rule: edit this file, then ask the assistant to
> "sync the Fabric Admin Agent page to spec" — only the matching page +
> route data will change.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/products/fabric-admin-agent` (explicit; **declared before** the catch-all `/products/:slug`) |
| Page component | `src/pages/ProductFabricAdminAgent.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<TrustBanner />`, `<CTA />` |
| Self-contained sections | Hero, Impact, Features, Case studies, Testimonials, Marketplace — all inlined in the page (NOT reusing the retail-named industry components, which are hard-coded to retail copy) |
| Header nav | The Products mega-menu entry for Fabric Admin Agent (already exists via `products[]`) routes here automatically because the explicit route wins |

**Design goal:** match the density of the Retail industry page —
section padding `48–56px`, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`, multi-column layouts.

## 3. Section specs

### 3.1 Hero (2-column band)

- **Layout:** left (60%) = copy + CTAs, right (40%) = decorative tile mosaic (capacity gauge + workspace health bars + drift alerts).
- **Background:** `--maq-off-white`.
- **Padding:** `48px 32px`.

**Copy (literal):**
- **Eyebrow:** `FABRIC WORKLOAD`
- **H1:** `AI-powered capacity management for Microsoft Fabric`
- **Subhead:**
  > Fabric Admin Agent gives Microsoft Fabric administrators an AI copilot for capacity. It detects anomalies and usage spikes in real time, forecasts upcoming demand, and recommends actions to reduce throttling, eliminate waste, and optimize cost — so platform teams stay ahead of capacity issues instead of firefighting them.
- **Primary CTA:** `Request a walkthrough` (mail icon) → `mailto:customersuccess@maqsoftware.com?subject=Fabric%20Admin%20Agent%20-%20Walkthrough`
- **Secondary CTA:** `See capabilities` → scroll to `#fabric-admin-features`

**Right column — product hero image:**

- Source: `https://maqsoftware.com/images-new/isv/fabric-admin-agent-hero.svg` (the same SVG used on <https://maqsoftware.com/products/fabricadminagent>).
- Rendered with `<img>` (decorative, `alt=""`, wrapped in `aria-hidden="true"` container, `loading="eager"`, `decoding="async"`).
- Sizing: `width: 100%`, `max-width: 520px`, `height: auto`. Wrapper is a flex centered container with `8px` padding — no card background, border, or shadow (the SVG already has its own visual styling).
- The previous inline SVG mosaic (capacity gauge + workspace bars + drift alerts) is **replaced** by this image. Numbers like `98%`, `78/54/91`, etc., are no longer rendered.

### 3.2 Impact / outcome (4 stat cards, single row)

- **Section eyebrow:** `PROVEN OUTCOMES`
- **Title:** `Real impact for Microsoft Fabric platform owners`
- **Subhead:** `Numbers from MAQ Software Fabric Admin Agent deployments across enterprise tenants.`
- **Layout:** 4 cards in one row (2×2 below 960px). Each card: big number, label, 1-line source label.

| Metric | Label | Source label |
|---|---|---|
| `60%` | `Fewer capacity incidents after enabling autonomous monitoring` | `Enterprise Fabric tenant` |
| `24/7` | `Autonomous coverage across capacities, workspaces, and items` | `Always-on agent` |
| `5 min` | `Mean time to detect drift in permissions and SLAs` | `MTTD benchmark` |
| `30+` | `Fabric tenants monitored in production` | `Deployment footprint` |

### 3.3 Features overview (4-card grid)

- **Eyebrow:** `CAPABILITIES`
- **Title:** `What the Fabric Admin Agent does for you`
- **Section id:** `fabric-admin-features`
- **Layout:** 2×2 card grid (1 column below 640px). Each card: red icon + bold title + 2-line description.

| Icon (Fluent) | Title | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Pulse24Regular` | `24/7 health monitoring` | Capacity utilization, refresh SLAs, and item failures tracked across every workspace and domain in your tenant. |
| `Warning24Regular` | `Proactive risk alerts` | Surface issues before business users hit broken reports or throttled queries — alerts correlated, not noisy. |
| `Wrench24Regular` | `One-click remediation` | Suggested fixes (resize capacity, reassign workspace, archive orphaned items) execute with full audit trail. |
| `Eye24Regular` | `Tenant-wide visibility` | A single pane across capacities, domains, workspaces, lakehouses, warehouses, and semantic models. |

### 3.4 Case studies (3-card grid)

- **Eyebrow:** `FABRIC CASE STUDIES`
- **Title:** `How platform teams ship Fabric faster with MAQ Software`
- **Layout:** 3 columns ≥960px, 1 column below. Each card: sub-tag, title, 1–2 line teaser, "Read full story →" link.

| Sub-tag | Title | Teaser | Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Enterprise IT` | Modernizing retail BI with Microsoft Fabric and Power BI | A top-3 US retailer migrated to Fabric for 8× faster Power BI refresh and a governed lakehouse. | https://blog.maqsoftware.com/2025/12/modernizing-retail-business.html |

- **Footer link below grid:** `See all Fabric case studies →` → `https://maqsoftware.com/case-studies` (target external until route-filter exists).

### 3.5 Testimonials (2-card grid)

- **Eyebrow:** `WHAT CLIENTS SAY`
- **Title:** `Trusted by Microsoft Fabric platform leaders`
- **Layout:** 2-column quote cards (1 column below 960px). Each card: opening quote glyph, body, attribution.
- Mark as **placeholder copy** until marketing supplies signed-off testimonials.

| Quote | Attribution |
|---|---|
| `Fabric Admin Agent caught a throttling pattern on our F64 capacity before our morning standup. We resized in one click and avoided a board-level escalation.` | `Director, Data Platform — Fortune 500 retailer` |
| `We replaced three manual Fabric health checklists with the agent. Our platform team now spends weeks on roadmap work instead of firefighting.` | `Head of Analytics Engineering — Global manufacturer` |

### 3.6 Resources & Marketplace

This section replaces the prior "Marketplace offers" block. It mirrors the
Resources column on the official MAQ Software site
(<https://maqsoftware.com/products/fabricadminagent>) and the live
Microsoft commercial-marketplace listing for Fabric Admin Agent.

- **Section title:** `Resources & Marketplace`
- **Subhead:** `Get the agent from Microsoft AppSource, browse Azure Marketplace consulting offers, and explore deeper guidance from MAQ Software.`

#### 3.6.1 Featured marketplace banner (full-width, 1 card)

| Secondary CTA | `Browse all consulting offers` → `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/consulting-services?page=1&search=maq%20software` (opens new tab) |

#### 3.6.2 Resource grid (3-column, 6 cards)

- Whole card is the `<a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">`.

| Pill | Title | Description | Link |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AppSource` | `Fabric Admin Agent on Microsoft AppSource` | Install the agent directly from Microsoft AppSource and start protecting your Fabric capacities today. | `https://marketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/product/maqsoftware.fabricadminagent-preview?tab=Overview&flightCodes=f7b20ceffeeb4e1fab33185d0cd74d08` |
| `Consulting offers` | `MAQ Software offers on Azure Marketplace` | Browse all Azure Marketplace consulting offers from MAQ Software — Fabric, Power BI, AI, and modernization engagements. | `https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/consulting-services?page=1&search=maq%20software` |

#### 3.6.3 Out of scope

- We are NOT publishing the legacy 3-card placeholder set (`Fabric Capacity
  Optimization 2-Week Assessment`, `Fabric Tenant Health & Governance 4-Week
  PoC`, `Fabric FinOps Baseline`). They are superseded by the consulting-offers
  link, which is the canonical browse surface.

### 3.7 CTA — reuses shared `<CTA />`

No product-specific override required for v1. Mounted via the route entry in `App.tsx`.

### 3.8 Footer

Shared `<Footer />` (mounted in App). No changes.

## 4. Theming & visuals

- All red elements use `--maq-red`. All deep panels use `--maq-black`.
- Card hover: `border-color: var(--maq-red)`, lift shadow `0 6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`.
- Category pills: bg `--maq-red-pale`, text `--maq-red`, font 11px / 700 / uppercase / letter-spacing `0.06em`, padding `4px 8px`, radius `4px`.
- Section padding: vertical `48px` (hero `48–56px`).

---

## 5. Accessibility

- Hero illustration `aria-hidden="true"`.
- All quotes use `<blockquote><p>…</p><cite>…</cite></blockquote>`.
- All category pills are decorative; the actual `<a>` is the card title (whole-card link).
- All resource & marketplace links open in a new tab via `target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"`.
- The featured marketplace banner uses real https URLs — no placeholder anchors.

---

## 6. Build & verify

```powershell
npm run build        # must exit 0
```

A change to this spec is **done** when:
1. `npm run build` exits 0.
2. `/products/fabric-admin-agent` renders the exact copy in §3.
3. The generic `/products/:slug` route still routes other products to `ProductDetail`.
4. No other pages regress.

---

## 7. Out of scope (v1)

- Real Azure Marketplace deep links (placeholders `#` for now)
- Signed-off testimonials (placeholder copy until marketing supplies)
- Per-feature drill-down pages
- Localization
