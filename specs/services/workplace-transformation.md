# Service Page Spec — Workplace Transformation & Productivity

> Source: *(no existing maqsoftware.com page — this is a new service category per content-brief-services.md)*
> Sibling specs: [agentic-ai.md](agentic-ai.md), [business-apps.md](business-apps.md), [security-compliance.md](security-compliance.md)
> Generator: [../page-generator.md](../page-generator.md)

This is the **seventh** service-overview page in the new site. It is a **net-new**
service category — the old site does not have a dedicated workplace transformation
page. Content is synthesized from the content brief (`content-brief-services.md`),
MAQ Software's Microsoft Copilot specialization, and related case studies / blogs.

> **Priority:** P2 per content brief. Sales brief has not yet been submitted for
> this service. This spec uses **inferred** content aligned with MAQ Software's
> known Microsoft 365, SharePoint, Teams, Viva, and Microsoft Copilot delivery
> capabilities. All copy marked *(inferred)* must be reviewed with sales before
> publish.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/services/workplace-transformation` |
| Page component | `src/pages/ServiceWorkplaceTransformation.tsx` (self-contained — all sections, styles, and content inline) |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<TrustBanner />`, `<CTA />` |
| Reused service components | **None.** Self-contained like `ServiceBusinessApps.tsx`. |
| Header nav integration | Services mega-menu "Workplace transformation & productivity" → `/services/workplace-transformation` |

**Design goal:** identical visual rhythm to `/services/agentic-ai` — scannable,
dense, single-viewport sections. Vertical padding `48px` (hero `48–56px`),
parallel multi-column layouts, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`.

---

## 2. Page composition (top → bottom)

1. `<Announcement />` *(shared, rendered by `App.tsx`)*
2. `<Header />` *(shared, rendered by `App.tsx`, active state on "Services")*
3. Hero section              — §3.1
4. `<TrustBanner />` *(shared)*
5. Capabilities section       — §3.2  (4 capability pillars, tabbed list+detail)
6. Outcomes section           — §3.3  (3 business-outcome cards)
7. Case studies section       — §3.4  (4 related case studies)
8. Insights section           — §3.5  (3 blog insights)
9. Testimonials section      — §3.6  (placeholder until signed quotes available)
10. `<CTA />` *(shared)*
11. `<Footer />` *(shared, rendered by `App.tsx`)*

> **Global rule:** when a Testimonials section is rendered on this page, it must
> appear immediately before `<CTA />` (last content section). Eyebrow must be
> `TESTIMONIALS`; H2 must be `What our clients have to say`. Until signed quotes
> are available, the section is not rendered — only a placeholder comment marks
> the slot in the JSX.
