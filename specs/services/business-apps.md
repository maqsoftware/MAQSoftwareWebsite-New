# Service Page Spec — Business Apps & Process Automation

> Source: https://maqsoftware.com/services/application-modernization
> Sibling specs: [agentic-ai.md](agentic-ai.md), [../industries/retail.md](../industries/retail.md), [../products/fabric-admin-agent.md](../products/fabric-admin-agent.md)
> Generator: [../page-generator.md](../page-generator.md)

This page now follows the current service-page pattern used across the site:
a thin route component in `src/pages/ServiceBusinessApps.tsx` that composes
page-owned sections from `src/components/services/business-apps/`.

The goal is maintainability. Shared behavior stays in shared wrappers and the
Business Apps content stays local to this slice, so changes to one service do
not force broad edits in unrelated pages.

> **Naming note:** The old site labels this service **Application modernization**.
> The new content brief (`content-brief-services.md`) renames it
> **Business apps & process automation**. We use the new label site-wide and a
> shorter slug, `/services/business-apps`.

---

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/services/business-apps` |
| Page component | `src/pages/ServiceBusinessApps.tsx` (thin composer only) |
| Page-owned sections | `src/components/services/business-apps/BusinessAppsHero.tsx`, `BusinessAppsCapabilities.tsx`, `BusinessAppsOutcomes.tsx`, `BusinessAppsCaseStudies.tsx`, `BusinessAppsInsights.tsx` |
| Shared layout | `<Header />` and `<Footer />` come from `App.tsx`; the page itself renders `<TrustBanner />` and `<CTA />` |
| Shared service wrappers | Not required for this page; Business Apps uses page-owned components for maintainability |
| Header nav integration | Services mega-menu "Business apps & process automation" → `/services/business-apps` |

**Design goal:** identical visual rhythm to `/services/agentic-ai` — scannable,
dense, single-viewport sections. Vertical padding `48px` (hero `48–56px`),
parallel multi-column layouts, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`.

---

## 2. Page composition (top → bottom)

1. Hero section               — §3.1
2. `<TrustBanner />`          *(shared)*
3. Capabilities section       — §3.2  (4 capability pillars, tabbed list+detail)
4. Outcomes section           — §3.3  (3 business-outcome cards)
5. Case studies section       — §3.4  (4 related case studies)
6. Insights section           — §3.5  (3 blog insights)
7. Testimonials section *[hidden — placeholder comment only; see §3.6]*
8. `<CTA />`                  *(shared)*

> `App.tsx` owns the surrounding `<Header />` and `<Footer />`.
>
> **Global rule (carried over from `agentic-ai.md`):** when a
> Testimonials section is rendered on this page in the future, it must appear
> immediately before `<CTA />` (last content section). Eyebrow must be
> `TESTIMONIALS`; H2 must be `What our clients have to say`. Until signed
> quotes are available, the section is not rendered. A placeholder comment
> remains in `src/pages/ServiceBusinessApps.tsx` marking that slot.

## 7. Brand rules (must hold)

- Always "MAQ Software" (never bare "MAQ")
- "26 years"
- All primary CTAs → `customersuccess@maqsoftware.com`
- Service name in headings, nav, and SEO uses the new label **Business apps & process automation**; the old "Application modernization" label is preserved only where it appears verbatim inside source URLs (case-study filter, related case-studies link).
