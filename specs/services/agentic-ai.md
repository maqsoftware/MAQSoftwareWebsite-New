> Generator: [../page-generator.md](../page-generator.md)

Security) should reuse the section taxonomy defined here.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/services/agentic-ai` |
| Page component | `src/pages/ServiceAgenticAI.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<TrustBanner />`, `<CTA />` |
| New service building blocks | `src/components/services/ServiceHero.tsx`, `ServiceCapabilities.tsx`, `ServiceOutcomes.tsx`, `ServiceProducts.tsx`, `ServiceCaseStudies.tsx`, `ServiceInsights.tsx` |
| Header nav integration | Services mega-menu "Agentic AI & ML" → `/services/agentic-ai` |

**Design goal:** scannable, dense, single-viewport sections. Vertical padding `48px`
(hero `48–56px`), parallel multi-column layouts, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`. No
oversized hero.

## 8. Build & verify

```powershell
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173/#/services/agentic-ai
npm run build        # must exit 0
```

Done when:
1. `npm run build` exits 0.
2. Page renders the exact copy in §3.
3. Route `/services/agentic-ai` is reachable from the URL.
4. Other pages do not regress.

## 9. Out of scope (v1)

- Per-capability landing pages (capabilities currently mailto).
- Live CMS for case studies and insights.
- Header mega-menu wiring for all 6 services (only Agentic AI link needs to be active).
- Localization.
