# Industry Page Spec — Healthcare & Life Sciences

> Sibling document to [retail.md](retail.md) and
> [financial-services.md](financial-services.md).
> Same authoring rules apply: edit this file, then ask the assistant to
> "sync code to spec" and only the matching page data in
> `src/pages/IndustryHealthcareLifeSciences.tsx` will change.
>
> All six shared industry components are content-driven via props. No component
> file needs to change when updating Healthcare & Life Sciences copy.
>
> **Content sourcing note.** The MAQ Software case-study catalog has no
> dedicated healthcare studies (see
> [case-studies-shortlist.md](case-studies-shortlist.md) — "Healthcare & life
> sciences: 0 dedicated studies"). Per the shortlist recommendation, this page
> uses **cross-industry agentic AI / secure-Copilot / AI-CoE / information-
> retrieval case studies** as honest proxies. Each proxy is clearly tagged so
> readers understand the lineage. No metrics are invented.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/industries/healthcare-life-sciences` (client-side, react-router-dom) |
| Page component | `src/pages/IndustryHealthcareLifeSciences.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />` from home |
| Shared building blocks | All six components in `src/components/industries/` — no new components needed |
| Header nav integration | Industries mega-menu "Healthcare & life sciences" → `/industries/healthcare-life-sciences` |

**Design goal:** identical density and visual rhythm to the Retail and Financial Services pages. Same `48px` section padding, same compact typography, same component order. No new design tokens, no new components — only props.

### 3.3 SolutionShowcase — "Bring AI to the care continuum and the research lifecycle"

- **Section id:** `hls-solutions`
- **Eyebrow:** `AGENTIC AI`
- **Title:** `Bring AI to the care continuum and the research lifecycle`
- **Layout:** same white rounded panel as retail/FS — left detail pane + right selectable rail. Default selection = item #1 (Clinical Knowledge Copilot).

**Agents (4):**

| # | Name | Tagline | Icon | Description (left pane) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Clinical Knowledge Copilot` | `Cited answers without leaving the EHR` | `Chat24Regular` (red) | Natural-language Copilot grounded in your clinical guidelines, formulary data, and policy library. Care teams ask plain-English questions and get citation-backed answers in seconds — without leaving the EHR workflow. Built on Azure OpenAI with role-based access controls aligned to your HIPAA and HITECH program. |
| 2 | `Care Coordination Agent` | `Close cross-team gaps for high-risk patients` | `PersonHeart24Regular` (red) | Autonomous agent that watches admission, discharge, and transfer events across systems, then orchestrates the right next action — referrals, follow-ups, social-work outreach — so high-risk patients do not fall through cross-team gaps. Integrates with Epic, Cerner, and Microsoft Fabric to produce a single longitudinal view of every patient. |
| 3 | `Population Health Insights Agent` | `Risk stratification on live data, not last year's report` | `HeartPulse24Regular` (red) | Risk-stratification and outcome-forecasting agent that runs on Microsoft Fabric or Databricks. Combines claims, clinical, and social determinants of health (SDoH) data to surface rising-risk cohorts and quantify intervention impact — so population health and value-based care teams act on live signals, not stale quality reports. |
| 4 | `Life Sciences Research Agent` | `Cohort discovery from question to insight` | `Beaker24Regular` (red) | Unifies lab, clinical-trial, and real-world-evidence data into a governed research workspace on Microsoft Fabric and Databricks. The agent accelerates cohort discovery, study-feasibility analysis, and 21 CFR Part 11–ready audit trails so research teams move from question to insight without manual data wrangling. |

---

### 3.7 CTA

Shared `<CTA />`. No healthcare-specific override for v1.

### 3.8 Footer

Shared `<Footer />`. No changes.

---

## 4. Theming & visuals

Identical to retail and financial services pages — no new tokens or overrides:
- Red elements: `--maq-red` (`#BA141A`)
- Card hover: `border-color: var(--maq-red)`, lift shadow `0 6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`
- Category pills: bg `--maq-red-pale`, text `--maq-red`, `11px / 700 / uppercase`
- Section padding: `48px` vertical throughout

---

## 5. Accessibility

- All interactive cards are `<button>` or `<a>`, focusable, visible focus ring.
- Selected solution rail item exposes `aria-current="true"`.
- Decorative hero illustration carries `aria-hidden="true"`.
- All quotes use `<blockquote><p>…</p><cite>…</cite></blockquote>`.
- Status badges in the hero visual use text labels (Critical / Watch / Stable / Routine / Discharge) — color is **not** the sole signal.

---

## 6. Build & verify

```powershell
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173/industries/healthcare-life-sciences
npm run build        # must exit 0
```

A change to this spec is **done** when:
1. `npm run build` exits 0.
2. The Healthcare & Life Sciences page renders with the exact copy in §3.
3. Header "Industries → Healthcare & life sciences" navigates to the page.
4. No other pages regress.

---

## 7. How to update this page

Edit the copy tables in §3 above, then ask the assistant to "sync the healthcare and life sciences page to spec". It will diff against `src/pages/IndustryHealthcareLifeSciences.tsx` and update only the changed values.

---

## 8. Out of scope (v1)

- Per-agent landing pages (agents currently mailto).
- Live CMS for testimonials.
- Live Azure Marketplace URLs (replaced when listings are published).
- A dedicated MAQ blog post for healthcare — when one ships, swap the cross-industry proxies in §3.2 and §3.4.
