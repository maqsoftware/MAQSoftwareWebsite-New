# Generic Page-Spec Generator

A reusable prompt for turning any `maqsoftware.com` page into a structured page spec that matches the current routed MAQ Software site architecture.

Hand this file plus a target URL to any agent (or person) and they can produce a build-ready spec that fits the thin-page, page-owned-components pattern used in `src/pages/` and `src/components/`.

---

## How to use

1. Open the target page on maqsoftware.com (or pass the URL).
2. Send the agent: **"Use `page-generator.md`. Target URL: `<url>`. Output file: `spec-<kind>-<slug>.md`."**
3. Review the output. Hand the spec to dev — they implement without further questions.

## Prompt (copy-paste to agent)

> You are generating a page-build spec for the new MAQ Software website.
>
> ### Inputs
> - `TARGET_URL` — a live maqsoftware.com page (e.g. `https://maqsoftware.com/products/fabricadminagent`).
> - `OUTPUT_FILE` — `spec-<kind>-<slug>.md` where `<kind>` is one of `home | product | service | industry | insights | partnership | about | contact | case-study` and `<slug>` is kebab-case.
>
> ### Step 1 — Classify the page
> Fetch `TARGET_URL`. From the URL path and visible content, classify it as one of:
> `home`, `product`, `service`, `industry`, `insights`, `partnership`, `about`, `contact`, `case-study`.
> Pick the matching reference spec:
> - product → mirror `products/fabric-admin-agent.md`
> - industry → mirror `industries/retail.md`
> - insights → mirror `insights/casesstudies.md`
> - partnership → mirror `partnerships/microsoft.md`
> - others → adapt the same routed-page taxonomy
>
> ### Step 2 — Migrate ALL content (verbatim, nothing dropped)
> Read the **entire** live page top-to-bottom. The goal is **full content migration**, not summarization — every visible block on the source page must land somewhere in the new spec.
>
> Do this in two passes:
>
> **Pass A — inventory.** List every content block on the source page in order: section heading, copy, bullets, images, links, embedded media, FAQs, tables, badges, footnotes. Note word count per block. Nothing skipped.
>
> **Pass B — map to the new 9-section structure.** For each inventoried block, assign it to the closest target section (Hero / Impact / Features / Case studies / Testimonials / Resources / etc.). If a block does not fit any standard section, add it under a new `### 3.7 Additional content` subsection rather than dropping it.
>
> Extract verbatim:
> - Eyebrow, H1, subhead, hero illustration URL (the `.svg` under `images-new/`)
> - Primary + secondary CTA labels and targets
> - Impact / outcome metrics (number + label + source) — keep **all** of them
> - **Full** feature list with the **full** description text (do not trim to one line; preserve original copy)
> - Case-study references (customer + outcome paragraph + link)
> - Testimonial quotes (full text + attribution + role + company)
> - Resource / marketplace links (label + URL + description)
> - Compliance / trust badges, certifications, partner logos
> - FAQs (question + full answer)
> - Any tables, comparison grids, pricing, or process diagrams (recreate as markdown tables / ordered lists)
> - Embedded videos / demos (URL + caption)
> - Footnotes, disclaimers, legal copy
> - Page meta: `<title>`, `<meta description>`, canonical, OG image
> - If the source URL already corresponds to a first-party route on the new site, preserve it as the primary destination and document any fallback redirect behavior separately.
>
> **Reconciliation check:** after Pass B, diff the Pass A inventory against the spec. Every inventoried block must appear in the spec. Report any intentionally dropped block with a one-line reason.
>
> ### Step 3 — Emit the spec file
> Write `OUTPUT_FILE` with this exact structure:
>
> ```markdown
> # <Kind> Page Spec — <Page Name>
>
> > Source: <TARGET_URL>
> > Sibling specs: products/fabric-admin-agent.md, industries/retail.md
>
> ## 1. Route & file layout
> | Concern | Choice |
> |---|---|
> | Route | /<kind>s/<slug> |
> | Page component | src/pages/<PascalCase>.tsx (thin composer) |
> | Page-owned sections | src/components/<slice>/... when the page has custom sections |
> | Shared shell | Header + Footer owned by App.tsx; TrustBanner / CTA only where that route uses them |
> | Header nav integration | The matching mega-menu or route entry points to /<kind>s/<slug> |
> | Redirect / local-first guidance | Document first-party route behavior first, then any legacy redirect or external fallback |
>
> ## 2. Page composition (top → bottom)
> 1. Hero — §3.1
> 2. TrustBanner — optional, when the route uses it
> 3. Impact / outcome — §3.2
> 4. Features overview — §3.3
> 5. Case studies — §3.4
> 6. Insights / resources / marketplace — §3.6
> 7. Testimonials — §3.5  *(if present, this must always be the last content section, immediately before CTA)*
> 8. CTA — optional, depending on the route shell or page composer
>
> ## 3. Section specs
>
> ### 3.1 Hero
> - Layout, background, padding (use Editorial Red tokens)
> - Eyebrow / H1 / subhead (verbatim from source)
> - Primary CTA → mailto:customersuccess@maqsoftware.com?subject=...
> - Secondary CTA
> - Hero image: official SVG URL from maqsoftware.com (img with alt="", aria-hidden, loading="eager")
>
> ### 3.2 Impact (4-card grid)
> | Metric | Label | Source |
>
> ### 3.3 Features (cards)
> | Icon | Title | Description |
>
> ### 3.4 Case studies (cards)
> | Customer | Outcome | Link |
>
> ### 3.5 Testimonials (carousel/grid)
> - **Eyebrow:** `TESTIMONIALS` (required, exact text)
> - **H2 title:** `What our clients have to say` (required, exact text — applies to every page that ships testimonials)
> - **Layout:** 2-column quote cards on `--maq-off-white`, opening quote glyph in `--maq-red` at 18% opacity, body in `--maq-black`, attribution in `--maq-gray-600` (uppercase, 12px, weight 600).
>
> | Quote | Attribution |
>
> ### 3.6 Insights / Resources / Marketplace
> | Label | URL | Description |
>
> ## 4. Theming
> Editorial Red tokens only (--maq-red, --maq-red-pale, --maq-off-white,
> --maq-surface-cream, --maq-black, --maq-ink, --maq-gray-500/600/700, --maq-border).
> Section background alternation: white / off-white.
>
> ## 5. SEO
> - title: <verbatim>
> - description: <verbatim>
> - canonical: https://maqsoftware.com<route>
> - og:image: <url>
>
> ## 6. Brand rules (must hold)
> - Always "MAQ Software" (never bare "MAQ")
> - "26 years"
> - All primary CTAs → customersuccess@maqsoftware.com
> ```
>
> ### Step 4 — Self-check before returning
> - Pass A inventory ↔ spec reconciliation done; zero unintentional drops.
> - Every literal string came from `TARGET_URL` (or is explicitly marked `[PLACEHOLDER]`).
> - Hero image URL is the live `.svg` under `maqsoftware.com/images-new/`.
> - Full feature/case-study/testimonial copy preserved (not trimmed).
> - Section order matches the routed-page structure actually used by the target page.
> - No invented metrics, customers, or quotes.
> - Brand rules hold.
> - Header nav integration names the correct existing menu group or route entry.
> - Redirect guidance documents any first-party route, legacy redirect, and external fallback behavior distinctly.
>
> Return: path to `OUTPUT_FILE`, a 3-line summary of what was extracted, and the reconciliation report (blocks-in vs blocks-out, with reasons for any drops).

## Reference specs (do not modify; use as gold standard)

- [products/fabric-admin-agent.md](products/fabric-admin-agent.md)
- [industries/retail.md](industries/retail.md)
- [products/products.md](products/products.md)

---

## Example invocation

> "Use `page-generator.md`. Target URL: `https://maqsoftware.com/products/migratefast`. Output file: `products/migratefast.md`."

Agent should fetch the page, classify it as `product`, mirror the Fabric Admin Agent spec structure, populate every section from the live page, and write the new spec file.
