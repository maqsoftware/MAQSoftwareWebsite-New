# Partnership Page Spec — Microsoft

> Source: https://maqsoftware.com/who-we-are (primary), https://maqsoftware.com/ (supplementary), Azure Marketplace listings
> Sibling specs: spec-partnership-snowflake.md, spec-product-fabric-admin-agent.md, spec-industry-retail.md
>
> MAQ Software does not currently have a dedicated Microsoft partnership page on
> the existing website. This spec synthesizes Microsoft partnership content from
> the "Who we are" page, homepage, news, and marketplace listings into a
> purpose-built partnership page mirroring the Snowflake partnership structure.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/partnerships/microsoft` |
| Page component | `src/pages/PartnershipMicrosoft.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<TrustBanner />`, `<CTA />` |
| Self-contained sections | Hero, Why Microsoft, Partnership Highlights, Partnership Overview, Our Offerings, Marketplace Offerings, Blogs & Case Studies, Connect — all inlined in the page |
| Header nav integration | Partnerships mega-menu "Microsoft" → `/partnerships/microsoft` |
| Redirect (legacy) | Add host-level rewrite/redirect rules for `/partnerships/microsoft` only if your active hosting platform requires explicit route mapping |

**Design goal:** Match the density and structure of the Snowflake partnership page —
section padding `48–56px`, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`, multi-column layouts.

## 11. Reconciliation report

### Pass A — Source content inventory (synthesized from maqsoftware.com)

| # | Block | Source Page | Words (approx) | Mapped to |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Microsoft Fabric Featured Partner" tagline + intro | /who-we-are | ~30 | §3.1 Hero |
| 2 | 4 Solution Partner designations (badges) | /who-we-are | ~20 | §3.4 Overview |
| 3 | 9 Microsoft Specializations (list with links) | /who-we-are, footer | ~60 | §9 Reference table, §3.4 |
| 4 | Partnership stats (9 specializations, 4 designations, 5K+ certs, 200+ Fabric) | /who-we-are | ~30 | §3.3 Highlights |
| 5 | "25 years of excellence" / "Preferred Supplier since 2000" | /who-we-are | ~40 | §3.4 Overview |
| 6 | "Why choose MAQ Software" (Continuous delivery, Faster implementation, Cost effective, Immediate response) | /who-we-are | ~60 | §3.2 Why Microsoft (adapted) |
| 7 | Microsoft Power BI Partner of the Year 2021 award | /news | ~80 | §10 Recognition |
| 8 | 43 certified Power BI custom visuals (largest 3rd party publisher) | /Marketplace-Offers/Power-BI-custom-visuals | ~40 | §3.6 Marketplace |

| 13 | Partner page link (AppSource) | /who-we-are | ~10 | §3.4 Overview |
| 14 | Our partners section — Microsoft Preferred Supplier badge | /who-we-are | ~10 | §3.4 Overview |

### Pass B — Reconciliation

All 14 inventoried content blocks are mapped to spec sections. **Zero blocks dropped.**

**Notes:**
- The "Why choose MAQ Software" section (Continuous delivery, Faster implementation, Cost effective, Immediate response) was adapted into the "Why Microsoft" value props (§3.2) with Microsoft-specific framing rather than generic company selling points, since this is a partnership page focused on the Microsoft technology value.
- FabCon / MCAPS Tech Connect event details are captured in §10 Recognition as evidence of partnership depth; they are not rendered as standalone sections to avoid staleness.
- The Microsoft partnership page is a **new page** (no legacy URL exists), so no legacy redirect is needed beyond the SPA fallback.
