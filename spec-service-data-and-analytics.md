> Sibling specs: [spec-service-agentic-ai.md](spec-service-agentic-ai.md), [spec-product-fabric-admin-agent.md](spec-product-fabric-admin-agent.md)
> Generator: [spec-page-generator.md](spec-page-generator.md)

This page describes the Data & Analytics service surface and maps content from the existing MAQ site into the new 9-section page spec used across the site.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/services/data-and-analytics` |
| Page component | `src/pages/ServiceDataAndAnalytics.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<TrustBanner />`, `<CTA />` |
| New service building blocks | `src/components/service/ServiceHero.tsx`, `ServiceCapabilities.tsx`, `ServiceOutcomes.tsx`, `ServiceProducts.tsx`, `ServiceCaseStudies.tsx`, `ServiceInsights.tsx` |
| Header nav integration | Services mega-menu "Data & analytics" → `/services/data-and-analytics` |

**Design goal:** scannable, dense, single-viewport sections. Vertical padding `48px` (hero `48–56px`), parallel multi-column layouts, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`. No oversized hero.

---

## 2. Page composition (top → bottom)

1. `<Announcement />` *(shared)*
2. `<Header />` *(shared, active state on "Services")*
3. `<ServiceHero />`              — §3.1
4. `<TrustBanner />` *(shared)*
5. `<ServiceCapabilities />`      — §3.2  (capability pillars)
6. `<ServiceOutcomes />`          — §3.3  (3 business-outcome cards)
7. `<ServiceCaseStudies />`       — §3.4  (4 related case studies)
8. `<ServiceInsights />`          — §3.5  (3 blog insights)
9. `<ServiceTestimonials />`     — §3.6  (if present)
10. `<CTA />` *(shared)*
11. `<Footer />` *(shared)*

> **Global rule:** `<Testimonials />` is mandatory on every page and must always render immediately before `<CTA />` (last content section). Eyebrow must be `TESTIMONIALS`; H2 must be `What our clients have to say`.

## 4. Theming

Editorial Red v3 tokens only — `--maq-red`, `--maq-red-pale`, `--maq-off-white`,
`--maq-surface-cream`, `--maq-black`, `--maq-ink`, `--maq-gray-500/600/700`,
`--maq-border`. Section background alternation: off-white (hero), white (capabilities), off-white (outcomes), white (products), off-white (case studies), white (insights). Card hover: `border-color: var(--maq-red)`, shadow `0 6px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.06)`.

---

## 5. SEO

- **title:** `Data & Analytics Services | MAQ Software`
- **description:** `Drive success with data-driven insights — use MAQ Software's data & analytics solutions to transform your data into strategic insights that fuel growth and innovation.`
- **canonical:** `https://maqsoftware.com/services/data-and-analytics`
- **og:image:** `[PLACEHOLDER — to be supplied by marketing]`

---

## 6. Brand rules (must hold)

- Always "MAQ Software" (never bare "MAQ").
- 26 years of Microsoft delivery.
- All primary CTAs → `customersuccess@maqsoftware.com`.
- Single-product names exactly as on maqsoftware.com (AI-DataLens, MigrateFAST, Fabric Admin Agent, EmbedFAST, CertyFAST, LoadFAST).

---

## 7. Content reconciliation (Pass A → Pass B)

Source page blocks → target sections:

| Source block | Target |
|---|---|
| H1 "Drive success with data-driven insights" + subhead + Get started | §3.1 ServiceHero |
| "Our data & analytics capabilities" block and capability headings | §3.2 ServiceCapabilities |
| "Your business outcomes" cards | §3.3 ServiceOutcomes |
| "Data & analytics products" product links | §3.4 ServiceProducts |
| "Related case studies" 4 blog links | §3.5 ServiceCaseStudies |
| "Our data & analytics insights" 3 blog links | §3.6 ServiceInsights |
| Footer / specializations / ISO certs / support links | Shared `<Footer />` |

**Drops:** none intentionally. Where the live page provided only headings (no long copy), the heading has been preserved and a note added to expand details during implementation.

---

## 8. Build & verify

```powershell
npm run dev          # http://localhost:5173/#/services/data-and-analytics
npm run build        # must exit 0
```

Done when:
1. `npm run build` exits 0.
2. Page renders the exact copy in §3.
3. Route `/services/data-and-analytics` is reachable from the URL.
4. Other pages do not regress.

## 9. Out of scope (v1)

- Per-capability landing pages (capabilities currently mailto).
- Live CMS for case studies and insights.
- Header mega-menu wiring for all services (only this route needs to be active now).
- Localization.
