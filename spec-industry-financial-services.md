# Industry Page Spec — Financial Services

> Sibling document to [spec-industry-retail.md](spec-industry-retail.md). Same authoring rules apply:
> edit this file, then ask the assistant to "sync code to spec" and only the
> matching page data in `src/pages/IndustryFinancialServices.tsx` will change.
>
> All six shared industry components are content-driven via props. No component
> file needs to change when updating Financial Services copy.

---

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/industries/financial-services` (client-side, react-router-dom) |
| Page component | `src/pages/IndustryFinancialServices.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />` from home |
| Shared building blocks | All six components in `src/components/industries/` — no new components needed |
| Header nav integration | Industries mega-menu "Financial services" → `/industries/financial-services` |

**Design goal:** identical density and visual rhythm to the Retail page. Same `48px` section padding, same compact typography, same component order.

4. No other pages regress.

---

---

- Azure Marketplace listing URLs (marked `// TODO` in source — fill in when listings are published)
- Signed-off testimonial quotes from marketing
