# Industry Page Spec — Manufacturing

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/industries/manufacturing` |
| Page component | `src/pages/IndustryManufacturing.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />` from home |
| Industry building blocks | Reuse `src/components/industry/IndustryHero.tsx`, `SolutionShowcase.tsx`, `ImpactStats.tsx`, `IndustryCaseStudies.tsx`, `MarketplaceOffers.tsx`, `Testimonials.tsx` |
| Header nav integration | Industries mega-menu "Manufacturing" → `/industries/manufacturing` |
| Redirect (legacy) | Add `/expertise/manufacturing/manufacturing /industries/manufacturing 301` to `public/_redirects` if a legacy URL exists |

**Design goal:** same dense, scannable layout used by Retail — tight section padding (`48–56px`), multi-column layouts, compact typography.

## 3. Section specs

### 3.1 IndustryHero (compact, 2-column band)

- **Layout:** same 2-column band as Retail (left copy 60%, right visual 40%).
- **Background:** `--maq-off-white`.
- **Padding:** `48px 32px`.
- **Visual:** CSS-only manufacturing-themed dashboard tiles (inventory levels bar chart, vendor receipt processing status, production line throughput sparkline). All decorative (`aria-hidden="true"`).

**Copy (verbatim from content submission):**
- **Eyebrow:** `MANUFACTURING`
- **H1:** `Powering Smarter Manufacturing with AI-Driven Operations`
- **Subhead:**
  > Supply chain disruptions and manual vendor receipt processing are costing manufacturers time and margin they cannot afford to lose. Leading industrial organizations are deploying AI agents that monitor inventory in real time and automate goods receipt processing from delivery to ERP entry—all on a governed data foundation. At MAQ Software, we build and deploy those agents on Microsoft Fabric, Snowflake, and Databricks—connecting plant operations, supply chain, and procurement on a single platform. As a Top 25 Global Microsoft Partner and Microsoft Fabric Featured Partner, we take you from AI experimentation to enterprise-scale production—with governance, security, and measurable ROI built in.
- **Primary CTA:** `Contact us` (mail icon) → `mailto:customersuccess@maqsoftware.com?subject=Manufacturing%20-%20MAQ%20Software`
- **Secondary CTA:** `Explore manufacturing solutions` → scroll to `#manufacturing-solutions`

### 3.2 ImpactStats (4 outcome cards, single row)

- **Section eyebrow:** `PROVEN OUTCOMES`
- **Title:** `Real impact for manufacturing leaders`
- **Subhead:** `Numbers from MAQ Software engagements with global manufacturers.`
- **Layout:** 4 cards in one row (2×2 below 960px). Each card: big number, label, 1-line source.

**Cards:**

| Metric | Label | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `40%` | Faster data onboarding across ten disconnected manufacturing systems — Microsoft Fabric and OneLake unification for a global medical devices manufacturer | [Unifying disconnected data systems](https://blog.maqsoftware.com/2026/01/unifying-disconnected-data-systems.html) |
| `[PLACEHOLDER]` | `[To be supplied by case study owner]` | — |
| `[PLACEHOLDER]` | `[To be supplied by case study owner]` | — |
| `[PLACEHOLDER]` | `[To be supplied by case study owner]` | — |

> **Note:** Impact stats #2–#4 are pending from the case study owner. Update this table when figures are available — the cards regenerate from it.

### 3.3 SolutionShowcase — "Manufacturing Agents"

- **Section id:** `manufacturing-solutions`
- **Eyebrow:** `AGENTIC AI`
- **Title:** `Make your manufacturing operations smarter with our Manufacturing Agents`
- **Layout:** same white rounded panel as Retail (left detail + right rail). Clicking a right-side item updates the left detail. Default selection = item #1.

**Agents (2):**

| # | Name | Tagline | Icon | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `Inventory Overview Agent` | `Real-time inventory visibility across warehouses, lines, and suppliers` | `BoxMultiple24Regular` (red) | Inventory blind spots across warehouses and production lines lead to costly stockouts, line stoppages, and excess safety stock. MAQ Software builds an agent that consolidates inventory data across locations, monitors stock levels against demand signals, and alerts operations teams to shortfalls before they disrupt production—on Microsoft Fabric with real-time data feeds and Power BI dashboards. Your supply chain and plant operations teams gain a single view of inventory across the enterprise, so replenishment decisions are made on current data rather than yesterday's report. |
| 2 | `Vendor Receipt Scanner` | `Automated goods receipt processing from vendor delivery to ERP entry` | `DocumentSearch24Regular` (red) | Manual goods receipt processing slows procurement cycles, introduces keying errors, and delays the three-way match between purchase orders, delivery notes, and invoices. MAQ Software builds an agent that scans vendor receipts, extracts delivery and quantity data using Azure AI Document Intelligence, validates against open purchase orders, and posts matched receipts into your ERP—on Microsoft Fabric with a full audit trail. Your procurement and warehouse teams close the goods receipt cycle in minutes rather than hours, reducing processing backlogs and duplicate-payment risk. |

- **Category label on both agents:** `Supply Chain & Inventory`
- **Button:** `Know More` — outlined red, opens `mailto:customersuccess@maqsoftware.com?subject={Agent name} — Manufacturing — MAQ Software`

### 3.4 IndustryCaseStudies (3 featured manufacturing studies)

- **Eyebrow:** `MANUFACTURING CASE STUDIES`
- **Title:** `How manufacturers move faster with MAQ Software`
- **Layout:** 3-column card grid. Each card: tag, title, 1–2 line teaser, "Read full story →" link.

**Cards:**

| Tag | Title | Teaser | Link |

> **Note:** Case study #3 is pending. Update this table when a new manufacturing case study is published.

- **Footer link:** `See all manufacturing case studies →` → `https://maqsoftware.com/case-studies`

### 3.5 Testimonials

- **Eyebrow:** `TESTIMONIALS`
- **Title:** `What our clients have to say`
- **Layout:** 2-column quote cards (single card centered when only 1 quote). Opening quote mark glyph (`"`), quote body, attribution line.

**Quotes:**

- **Title:** `Our Marketplace Offers`
- **Subhead:** `Accelerate manufacturing outcomes with ready-to-deploy Microsoft Azure Marketplace offerings — spanning AI strategy, real-time intelligence, and data platform modernization.`

1. `npm run build` exits 0.
2. The Manufacturing page renders with the exact copy in §3.
3. Header "Industries → Manufacturing" navigates to the page.
4. No other pages regress (home, retail, etc. stay unchanged).
