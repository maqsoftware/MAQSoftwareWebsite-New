> Sibling specs: [spec-service-agentic-ai.md](spec-service-agentic-ai.md), [spec-industry-retail.md](spec-industry-retail.md), [spec-product-fabric-admin-agent.md](spec-product-fabric-admin-agent.md)
> Generator: [spec-page-generator.md](spec-page-generator.md)

This is the **second** service-overview page in the new site, reusing the section taxonomy
defined in `spec-service-agentic-ai.md` as the authoritative service-page shape.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/services/cloud` |
| Page component | `src/pages/ServiceCloud.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />`, `<TrustBanner />`, `<CTA />` |
| Service building blocks | `src/components/service/ServiceHero.tsx`, `ServiceCapabilities.tsx`, `ServiceOutcomes.tsx`, `ServiceProducts.tsx`, `ServiceCaseStudies.tsx`, `ServiceInsights.tsx` |
| Header nav integration | Services mega-menu "Cloud optimization" → `/services/cloud` |

**Design goal:** scannable, dense, single-viewport sections. Vertical padding `48px`
(hero `48–56px`), parallel multi-column layouts, h2 `28–30px`, body `14px`. No
oversized hero. Match aesthetic and component reuse from Agentic AI service page.
