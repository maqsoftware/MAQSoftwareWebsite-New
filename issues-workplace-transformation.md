## Critical Issues

### 1. "Contact us" button (Hero section) links to mailto instead of /contact page

- **Location:** Hero section, primary CTA button
- **Current behavior:** Links to `mailto:customersuccess@maqsoftware.com?subject=Workplace%20Transformation%20%26%20Productivity%20-%20MAQ%20Software`
- **Expected behavior:** Should navigate to `/contact` page
- **Impact:** High — users expecting to land on the contact page are instead prompted to open an email client

### 2. "Contact us" button (Bottom CTA section) links to mailto instead of /contact page

- **Location:** "Ready to move faster?" CTA section near bottom of page
- **Current behavior:** Links to `mailto:customersuccess@maqsoftware.com?subject=Contact%20MAQ%20Software`
- **Expected behavior:** Should navigate to `/contact` page
- **Impact:** High — same issue as hero, affects conversion flow
