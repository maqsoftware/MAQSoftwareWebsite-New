# Industry Page Spec — Technology, Software & ISVs

> Sibling document to [spec.md](spec.md) (home page) and
> [spec-industry-retail.md](spec-industry-retail.md). Same authoring rules
> apply: edit this file, then ask the assistant to "sync code to spec" and only
> the matching components / route data will change.

## 1. Route & file layout

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Route | `/industries/technology` |
| Page component | `src/pages/IndustryTechnology.tsx` |
| Shared layout | Reuse `<Announcement />`, `<Header />`, `<Footer />` from home |
| Industry building blocks | Reuse `src/components/industries/IndustryHero.tsx`, `SolutionShowcase.tsx`, `ImpactStats.tsx`, `IndustryCaseStudies.tsx` |
| Header nav integration | Industries mega-menu "Technology" → `/industries/technology` |

**Design goal:** same dense, scannable layout used by Retail — tight section padding (`48–56px`), multi-column layouts, compact typography.

---
